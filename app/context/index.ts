    content: 'When providing feedback to the submission, make reference to specific areas in the submission that meet the criteria of the rubric and how it answers the prompt.\nThe  students were tasked with writing a rhetorical analysis to three different prompts. They were to choose one prompt and respond. I will break down the scoring criteria: \n Thesis: 0 to 1 point 0 Points - For any of the following: • There is no defensible thesis. \n • The intended thesis only restates the prompt. \n • The intended thesis provides a summary of the issue with no apparent or coherent claim. \n • There is a thesis, but it does not respond to the prompt. \n 1 Point - Responds to the prompt with a defensible thesis that analyzes the writer’s rhetorical choices. \n Evidence and commentary: 0 -4 points \n 0 points - Simply restates thesis (if present), repeats provided information, or offers information irrelevant to the prompt. \n 1 point- EVIDENCE: Provides evidence that is mostly general. AND COMMENTARY: Summarizes the evidence but does not explain how the evidence supports the student’s argument. \n 2 points -  EVIDENCE: Provides some specific relevant evidence. AND COMMENTARY: Explains how some of the evidence relates to the student’s argument, but no line of reasoning is established, or the line of reasoning is faulty. \n 3 points -  EVIDENCE: Provides specific evidence to support all claims in a line of reasoning. AND COMMENTARY: Explains how some of the evidence supports a line of reasoning. AND Explains how at least one rhetorical choice in the passage contributes to the writer’s argument, purpose, or message. \n 4 points -  EVIDENCE: Provides specific evidence to support all claims in a line of reasoning. AND COMMENTARY: Consistently explains how the evidence supports a line of reasoning. AND Explains how multiple rhetorical choices in the passage contribute to the writer’s argument, purpose, or message. \n Sophistication 0 to 1 point: 0 points - Does not meet the criteria for one point. \n 1 point - Demonstrates sophistication of thought and/or develops a complex understanding of the rhetorical situation. Responses that earn this point may demonstrate sophistication of thought and/or a complex understanding of the rhetorical situation by doing any of the following: 1. Explaining the significance or relevance of the writer’s rhetorical choices (given the rhetorical situation). 2. Explaining a purpose or function of the passage’s complexities or tensions. 3. Employing a style that is consistently vivid and persuasive. This point should be awarded only if the sophistication of thought or complex understanding is part of the student’s argument, not merely a phrase or reference.',

    content: "The three prompts to choose from are below: \n 1. Often in literature a character’s success in achieving goals depends on keeping a secret and divulging it only at the right moment, if at all. In a well-organized, multi-paragraphed essay, briefly explain the necessity for secrecy and how the character’s choice to reveal or keep the secret contributes to the meaning of the work as a whole. Support your analysis with evidence from the text.\n 2. Some novels, plays, or texts depict a central incident which serves as a focal point for a major theme or conflict. Select a central incident from a text above and explain how this incident is crucial and what theme or conflict it reveals. Support your analysis with evidence from the text.\n 3. In literature some characters are clearly heroic or villainous. Other characters, however, are ambiguous, displaying a mixture of positive and negative qualities. In a well-organized, multi-paragraphed essay, consider one character from one of the works above, and explain what makes that character ambiguous and the importance of the ambiguity."
